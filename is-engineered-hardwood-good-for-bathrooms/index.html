<p>But white oak red cedar and redwood are especially good options for a bathroom floor. There are several reasons we feel engineered hardwood is a great choice for a bathroom the first being the biggest for us. Of all hardwood flooring options engineered is a better choice for a bathroom than solid as plywood or solid wood bottom layers hold up against moisture relatively well and are very dimensionally stable. Engineered hardwood flooring is dimensionally stable and therefore does not fluctuate too much in response to humidity so its generally best to go with engineered floors instead of solid wood.

<p>Unlike solid wood which consists of a single piece of timber engineered is made up of several layers. Planks of natural solid wood real wood like youd find in the lumber section of a hardware store tend to shrink and expand as humidity changes which can cause cracks in the painted or veneered finish of your cabinets and in extreme cases this. On the other hand engineered wood flooring is a more budget-friendly flooring option. It should resist humidity but not standing water.
