<h3 id="residential-rubber-flooring-carpet-tiles-vinyl-mats-and-foam-pieces-are-all-viable-options-for-your-at-home-workout-room">Residential rubber flooring carpet tiles vinyl mats and foam pieces are all viable options for your at-home workout room.</h3><p>Lets take a look.

If you have a perfectly smooth and non-squishy floor the puzzle mats might work for a time but Ive read that the smaller parts that interlock dont always stay in place especially when very heavy things are placed on top. Theyll protect your floors from treadmills exercise bikes benches free weights and much more while also being super comfy to roll and safe to train hard on.</p>
