<p>There is simply too much moisture present in basements to comfortably install solid hardwood flooring. Engineered wood is made with a top layer of hardwood called the wear layer thats adhered to multiple layers of backing material creating a floorboard thats less affected by changes in temperature and relative humidity. You may want your lower level to match the design of your living room. Generally most people that have basements may also have wood floors above and wish to match the same look.
