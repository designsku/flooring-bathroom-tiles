<p>Bruce Natural Rustic Oak Smooth Engineered Hardwood 3 8 Inch X. We used it everywhere but the kitchen which has Bellawood Brazillian Walnut. It wasis the least expensive flooring they offer in a 34 plank at the time we got it for 255 psf on sale its normally 299 and looks very simular to the gunstock. Had the flooring company and a representative from Bruce come out to the house and they looked at my floors for 2 minutes and proceeded to tell me its a moisture problem.
