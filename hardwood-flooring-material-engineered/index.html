<p>Engineered hardwood flooring costs 4-16 per square foot. Engineered wood flooring is made up of several pieces of wood called wood piles and placed together with a heat process under pressure. The top layer is usually made from hardwood and the bottom may be plywood or another type of cheaper thinner wood. A solid hardwood floor can be sanded down and refinished about 10 times before the thickness of the material becomes an issue.
