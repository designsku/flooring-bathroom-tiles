<p>Ultraviolet UV technology has been used for years by hardwood manufacturers to cure finishes in the factory. UV cured hardwood floors rival aluminum oxide pre-finished floors in terms of durability and lifespan. UV curing is quicker than any other curing process. So not only do they protect against early-use wear and tear they offer greater durability in the long-term which further prolongs the life of the wood floor.

<p>As a hardwood flooring manufacturer which also operated a UV cured finishing line the UV lamps in simulating sunlight enabled me to experiment with many UV protected finishes. So if you are to get any UV protection for your wood at least it can be this one. In fact most pre-finished hardwood is made using this technology. Your hardwood floors need a durable finish that maintains the visual appeal and natural comfort of wood. Pin On Texture Background.</p>
