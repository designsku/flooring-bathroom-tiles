<p>Which direction to run hardwood flooring which direction should you angle your direction to install my laminate flooring should i lay my timber flooring. This is an option for single rooms or where only a few rooms are receiving the flooring. When placing wood floors in multiple rooms and a connecting hallway the boards should all be directed away from the main entrance to the hall and adjoining rooms should continue in that same direction. Apart from a few exceptions like sagging joists this is the preferred direction to lay wood floors because it aesthetically provides the best result.
