<p>The radiant heat that emits through the slab can wreak havoc on hardwood flooring pieces that are greater than 225 inches wide. Tongue-and-groove strips are recommended and beveled-edge boards show. You can also reduce gaps by using parquet flooring tongue-and-groove strips or boards with beveled edges. Some manufacturers even make hardwood floors specifically for radiant heat systems.</p>
<h3 id="some-installers-will-say-it-is-safe-to-install-widths-up-to-3-inches-but-smaller-widths-will-have-less-overall-movement-in-response-to-the-radiant-heating">Some installers will say it is safe to install widths up to 3 inches but smaller widths will have less overall movement in response to the radiant heating.</h3><p>The inherent dimensional stability of engineered hardwood floors makes it a great choice for radiant heat systems. Most important is good communication with the radiant heat system designer. The species we carry are Ash Cherry Hickory Maple Red Oak and White Oak. The maximum recommended width of a board used in hardwood flooring above radiant heat is 3 inches. Some installers will say it is safe to install widths up to 3 inches but smaller widths will have less overall movement in response to the radiant heating. Quartersawn or riftsawn are also considered better hardwood floor choices.</p>
