<p>The look and feel just add an element no other material can match but issues can arise when wooden flooring is suggested for the bathroom. Bathroom Floors that Look Like Hardwood Faux-hardwood surfaces floors that imitate the look of real wood so well its nearly impossible to tell the difference will work well.

In 95 of the bathrooms I do I use ceramic or porcelain tile and usually stick with standard floor tiles as long as they dont have a slippery surface.

Extra care should be taken during installment. Other reasons to use wood floors in the bathroom besides looks are ease and continuity.
