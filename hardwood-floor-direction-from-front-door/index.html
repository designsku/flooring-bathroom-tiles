<p>Apart from a few exceptions like sagging joists this is the preferred direction to lay wood floors because it provides the best result aesthetically. The most natural direction for your floors is to lay them perpendicular to the front door and continue in that direction all the way to the back of the house. Straight patterns are perfect for most rooms and the result is. Laying hardwood flooring vertically in this situation would make the illusion even worse.
