Traditional engineered wood flooring ranges from 12mm to 4mm that provides a sustainable foundation with extra durability.

<p>I am having a hard time deciding which floor to go with. I am having a hard time deciding which floor to go with. The SPC core is what makes this flooring so incredibly durable maintaining its form even over uneven subfloors. When it comes to top end SPC flooring like luxury SPC plank LVP or luxury SPC tile LVT prices can be a lot more higher ranging from 5 to 8 per square foot.
