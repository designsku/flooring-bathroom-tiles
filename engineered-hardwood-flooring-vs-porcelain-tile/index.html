<p>Hardwood requires regular sweeping or vacuuming plus the occasional use of a hardwood floor cleaner. I am trying to decide between putting an engineered wood floor or wood look porcelain tile floor over the concrete slab on the first floor of our home foyer and family room. Looking at a few various styles of engineered hardwood flooring a consumer would note that each has a timeless essence and promotes a warm and inviting feeling. Of course with tile flooring you can also install radiant heat underneath but this definitely adds to the cost.
