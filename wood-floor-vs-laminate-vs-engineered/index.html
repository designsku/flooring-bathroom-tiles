<p>In very general terms when you buy a laminate floor you can expect a maximum life expectancy of around 20 years whereas a quality engineered wood floor should last for up to 75 years. First laminate wood flooring is significantly less expensive than both hardwood and engineered wood flooring. Since engineered wood flooring is manufactured in a way that uses available resources more efficiently and often include recycled materials it can be viewed more eco. The difference in price however isnt that big. Flooring Faceoff Engineered Vs Solid Hardwood Floors Solid Hardwood Floors Engineered Wood Floors Flooring.</p>

<p>The main difference between the two floors is that engineered hardwood floors have an actual hardwood surface but structurally they are very similar to a laminate. The best way to describe engineered hardwood flooring is to think of it like a hybrid car. Laminate is actually one of the cheapest alternatives on the market but the quality is can be bad. Engineered wood flooring lasts between 20-100 years if properly maintained whereas laminate needs to be replaced after 10-20 years.
