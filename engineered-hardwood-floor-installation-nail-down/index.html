<p>One other pro of nailing down hardwood floors is that if one floorboard gets damaged it can be easily replaced without affecting the beauty of your floors. Also some adhesives act as acoustic barrier and some as moisture retardant. Clearly it is much easier to nail down a floor than to glue it down. Make sure butt ends of boards are offset at 6 inches from the previous row.

<p>Use the floor nailer for the following rows. Other products are better-suited for a nail-down installation where they are secured to a wood subfloor with nails or staples. Lay out three rows of flooring at a time before nailing called racking to ensure that boards are random in grain and colour. Nail-down installation is a straightforward way of fitting engineered or solid wood flooring but is only advisable if you have a wooden subfloor.
