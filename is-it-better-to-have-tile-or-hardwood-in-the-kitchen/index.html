<p>Now the rooms flow so much better. Hardwood is more durable in many ways but tile stands up to scratches from the paws of furry friends better than wood. Hardwood provides you with a softer more resilient surface to stand on than most tile and hard surface flooring options. In kitchens hardwood makes for a slightly more comfortable flooring surface than harder materials such as stone or ceramic tile but it is considerably harder than more resilient flooring materials such as vinyl or cork.

<p>Wooden floors will provide a comfortable space to stand in your kitchen. This is especially important if you spend a lot of time in the kitchen cooking or entertaining or both.
