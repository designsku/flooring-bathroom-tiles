<p>A couple of weeks ago I arranged to have our flooring measured by Home Depot and get a quote on how much this part of our renovation was going to cost me. Likewise how much does Home Depot charge for tile install. Their average price is roughly 4 per square foot and the more expensive slate tiles cost up to 7 per square foot. I scheduled the visit to my house using their online system and plunked down the 35 which includes measuring moisture testing and leveling estimates and contributes to your flooring cost if you order the install through Home Depot.
