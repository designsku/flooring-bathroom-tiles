<p>On older homes with hardwood floors if the cabinets are removed they may need to be refinished anyway since the floors usually are never sanded and stained under the cabinets but it beats a tie in and refinish. As previously mentioned in this article its okay to install hardwood under kitchen cabinets because hardwood is nailed into place and does not require room to expand or contract in the same sense as a laminate flooring does. Installing kitchen base cabinets before flooring can be a money-saving advantage. The flooring under the cabinets is a waste of materials and will make your project cost more.

<p>Its just a matter. If theres flooring under the cabinets you lose 12-34 in height depending on the thickness of the flooring. Theres no concern for the moisture in your kitchen affecting the floor. Unlike natural hardwood flooring engineered wont warp or expand due to the heat of your oven. 28 Fantastic Farmhouse Kitchen Remodel Farmhouse Kitchen Remodel Farmhouse Style Kitchen Rustic Kitchen.</p>
