<p>Strip to wood floor. Based on these factors and from the quotes we did find online it appeared it could cost anywhere from 350 to 6 per square foot to have a contractor via Home Depot install your tile for a fairly straightforward job. Hardwood installation is pricier than vinyl tile installation. Home Depot charges a 59 delivery fee for your floors in our area even if theyre doing the installation.
