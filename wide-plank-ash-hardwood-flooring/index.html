<p><strong>Wide Plank Ash Hardwood Flooring</strong>, Because Ash wood is strong straight grained and slightly springy it has traditionally been used for baseball bats canoe paddles and tool handles and we still make Ash lumber for these purposes.

The main reason for this is because the wider planks are made from older growth trees which are more valuable.</p>
